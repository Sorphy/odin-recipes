    <h1>Honey Biscuits Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/honey-biscuits.jpg" alt="honey-biscuits image">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These buttery biscuits get a light hint of sweetness from added honey. Serve them warm, with additional honey, jam, or whatever you like on your biscuits.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cold buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Stir together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter using a pastry blender or two forks until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Stir honey and buttermilk together in a cup. Pour into flour mixture and stir until mixture comes together.</li>
        <li>Turn mixture out onto a lightly-floured work surface. Press dough into a rectangle shape about 1/2 inch thick. Fold mixture into thirds, like a letter, then turn 90 degrees and press again into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Fold dough into thirds again, turn 90 degrees, and press into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Fold dough into thirds one more time, and now press into a thicker rectangle, about 1-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Cut biscuits with a 2-inch round cookie cutter. Place biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet about 1 inch apart. Gently press remaining dough back together and cut biscuits; place onto the baking sheet. Press together any remaining dough scraps to form final biscuits.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits begin to turn golden, 13 to 15 minutes. Cool on a rack for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong><em>For an even sweeter biscuit, you can add up to 1/4 cup honey to the dough. You can also use up to 1 teaspoon kosher salt for a slightly saltier biscuit. This recipe makes about 10 biscuits using a 2-inch cutter, but will make more or fewer depending on the size cutter you use.</em></strong></p>
